# TimeMachine
The TimeMachine website project developed by Rahul Bairagi is built on the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This technology stack is widely used for building robust and scalable web applications.

   - Clone the code-

     ```
     git clone <repo-link>

     cd TimeMachine
     ```

3. Setup the backend code -

   - Create a `config.env` file and the format should be as given in `env.example`.
